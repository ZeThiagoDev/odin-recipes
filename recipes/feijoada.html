        <li>200g of pepperoni sausage</li>
        <li>200g of pork rib</li>
        <li>150g of bacon</li>
        <li>1 medium size onion chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (soup) of chopped parsley</li>
        <li>A pinch of paprika</li>
        <li>A pinch of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 orange</li>

        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak the carne seca (biltong) for 24 hours in cold water (change the water three times over this period of
            time).</li>
        <li>If using dried beans, soak them overnight.</li>
        <li>Rinse salted meat under running water to remove any excess salt.</li>
        <li>Bring the biltong to a boil for 20 to 25 minutes, on a very high flame. Drain and remove any further excess
            fat.</li>
        <li>After this pre-preparation, start preparing the feijoada…</li>
        <li>Heat some oil in a large pan, stirring in the onion and then the garlic until golden, add the spices.</li>
        <li>Next, add the toughest meat in large pieces and cook for about 30 minutes then add less tough cuts and cook
            for another thirty minutes, and finally add the most tender meats.</li>
        <li>Add the beans, with some water and the bay leaf.</li>
        <li>As the meat is being cooked (this you will know by testing them with a fork, the reason they should be
            cooked in large
            pieces) remove from the beans, then cut them into small pieces to serve. Reserve them.</li>
        <li>Season the beans with traditional seasoning. Return these small pieces of meat to the beans, and cook for
            about half an hour.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and decorate with sliced orange and parsley!</li>
    </ol>
